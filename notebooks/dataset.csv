288998,09/26/2015,Debt collection,Medical,False statements or representation,Indicated committed crime not paying,"Was told by XXXX different people that if I paid the debt in full Amercian Medical Collections would remove the info from my credit report. They have failed to do as promised. I have an immaculate credit report and want to keep it clean. I paid it as soon as I got it. I moved for 2 years and was forwarded the notice from the new tenants. Paper says pay in full and no bad debt reporting. They simply lie to get what they want. You should n't allow these tactics. I always pay my debts and always pay them on time. I think they need to honor their promise and remove this from my credit report. They need to reprimanded for the lies they tell the debtors in order to collect. I paid the full amount and did n't even negotiate the amount because they were going to remove it within 3 days since I paid it in full via their website the day I spoke with them. This is just so unfair. Please investigate their tactics to be sure they do n't scam or lie to others as well. I worked hard my whole life to establish a great credit score and this one bad mark lowered my score drastically for at least 6 months. They ruined my credit because of their failure to keep their promise. Thank you for listening and possibly helping to resolve this issue and protect others from these tactics.

Years ago, I agreed to a recurring charge in order to watch their video products. For over a year, I have been trying through every means possible to cancel the recurring charges on my credit card. I have repeatedly used their online forms and followed the steps listed on their website, to no avail. I tried calling the company ( finding the number was a research feat in itself ), and further got no action. I have repeatedly contacted the credit card company to cancel the charges, and I think the current options for this situation are too limited. Because the charge is so small, generally the credit card company credits my account and essentially pays the bill themselves. I need to do this each month. I was told that XXXX might even find me after getting a new credit card through the same bank, and resume charging me on the new card. It 's incredibly frustrating that my only option seems to be to repeatedly contest the charge each month, with the result that my credit card company rather than myself pays these thieves. 

I think this situation is very common, and I believe new laws and policies need to be pyut in place to help consumers and to make it impossible for this egregious behavior on the part of companies to continue. It should be possible for consumers to permanently remove recurring charges from their credit cards, without the consent of the company involved. This would shift the burden of re-establishing a financial relationship to where it belongs : back to the company that made it impossible to cancel recurring charges. I write to urge you to make this happen. Companies like XXXX should not be able to succeed in garnering money from recurring charges when they make it impossible for consumers to cancel the charges.

191335,03/19/2015,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt resulted from identity theft,"In XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report regarding my wallet being stolen which had money, credit cards, driver 's license, SS card, and checks. I immediately went to my bank and closed the account and reopened a new one and received new checks with a different account number. The person who stole my wallet had used my debit card ... but since it was still pending ... the bank was able to block the withdrawal. I placed a fraud alert on my credit reports and I got a new driver 's license and then ended up getting a XXXX one with my new name since I had married. 
Last week I received a letter from Meade & Associates attempting to collect on a debt from XXXX checks written on my old account with my old drivers license name starting in XX/XX/XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX and he agreed that everything was done correctly, I just needed to send him the information from my bank and the police report along with my current drivers license. I requested that he send me copies of the checks that were written, which he did. I went to my bank and they did not have anything specific since nothing actually went through my account at the time. However, they new I had closed that account and reopened the new one and that I had presented them with a police report. They wrote me a letter to give to XXXX XXXX and I was able to retrieve the police report online. Monday, XXXX XXXX, I faxed both of these documents along with my current drivers license, my actual signature, as well as the new police report number for the case filed with the forgery/fraud department. I followed up with a call to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday and was informed he was not available, but they would have him return my call. I called Wednesday afternoon and was then told that he had left early that day without returning my call. I asked if anyone else could help. I was transferred to XXXX. She obtained the documents that I had faxed and I explained to her I wanted to finalize clearing this ordeal. She became hateful and kept saying she needed documents that I she already had. She stated I still needed an affidavit from my bank stating I did not write the checks ... she refused to listen to anything I had to say and acted is if it did not matter what I sent ... it was n't going to make a difference. At that point I definitely became angry and she told me to never call that office again. I called my bank and told them what was going on and they stated that XXXX did not know what she was talking about because the bank never had me sign an affidavit because nothing had actually gone through my account since I had immediately blocked all transactions due to closing the account. The check transactions even clearly say that when they were processed there was no account found. I am currently waiting for my case to be assigned to a detective ... but I am filing reports and claims to help prevent any more aggravation from this company and hope they will learn that you ca n't treat people like criminals when they are the victims in some circumstances ... especially when they present facts and proof.
